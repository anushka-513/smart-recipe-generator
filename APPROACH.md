The goal of this project was to build a Smart Recipe Generator that helps users discover recipes based on the ingredients they already have. My approach was to focus on a clean, user-friendly design while ensuring the core features work reliably.

I started by creating a small recipe database with at least 20 recipes. Each recipe includes ingredients, step-by-step instructions, nutritional details, and dietary tags such as vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free. To make the app more helpful, I added filters for difficulty, cooking time, and dietary preferences, so users can quickly find what suits them.

For ingredient input, users can either type items manually or try the mock image upload feature, which simulates how an AI service would recognize ingredients from a photo. Once the input is provided, a matching algorithm compares the userâ€™s ingredients against the recipe database and suggests the closest matches. Missing ingredients are also shown with possible substitutions.

I also included the ability to rate recipes and save favorites, which feeds into personalized recommendations. The entire app is mobile-responsive, deployed on Vercel for easy access, and designed with intuitive navigation. Overall, my focus was on practical functionality, good UX, and clean code.
